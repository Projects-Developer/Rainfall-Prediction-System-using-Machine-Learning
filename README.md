## Abstract:
Accurate rainfall prediction is crucial for various applications, including agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness. This study proposes a machine learning-based rainfall prediction system that utilizes historical climate data and atmospheric conditions to forecast rainfall patterns. The system integrates data from weather stations, satellites, and radar systems to provide real-time predictions and alerts for heavy rainfall events. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving rainfall prediction accuracy, enabling better decision-making for various stakeholders.
